![hotel2](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/042fb64e-4978-4178-9bb6-893853787812)


You can either view your information, edit your information, delete your account or add a new one!

If go back and click on any hotel, you will go to this page:

![hotel3](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/203b455e-c8c9-4864-94f6-667e82a010e8)


You can now choose your check in and check out dates (there is input validation on them) and if you are happy, you can click on the button 'book':

![hotel4](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/ce7c2f5c-ffb3-46a2-8c9c-7a86d4205743)


OR you can scroll down and choose another hotel by comparison:

![hotel5](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/c33cffc5-c628-4ec5-bcd1-07ad4df775d6)


Here you can see which hotel will be more suitable by seeing if there is any price per night or rating similarity. You can just click on 'View More' to view that hotel instead:


However, if you are happy with the hotel and want to book it, then you will be directed to the booking summary:

![hotel6](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/48ed64c1-0a65-417f-b7f5-7ba8b2196aac)


If you click on 'Confirm Booking', then only will the information be pushed into the table.

You will then be directed to this page, where you can download a receipt and log out:

![hotel7](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/777b24de-ceca-48a2-91b6-07127029a330)


You can then log in again and choose to view your bookings:

![hotel8](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/28235f20-2232-40e0-9cdb-4f286fbdf4a3)


You can either delete the booking (only if the check in date is more than 2 days away from the current date) and you can download a receipt again.

------------------------------------------------------

Now you can log in as an employee (only admin will be able to make CRUD operations)

![staff1](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/65778797-a7df-4122-b2d4-e1645e015f97)


If you are a staff member, you will see this page:

![staff2](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/2c38ea0d-b1ba-4ec2-bc93-b172092df154)


If you are an admin, you will see this page:

![staff3](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/047301b9-e76e-451a-bc52-f3472a6004eb)


We will only focus on the admin, since they get to do CRUD operations:

If you clicked on the user button, then you will see this page:

![staff4](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/477c6e19-8481-489a-9eff-044a63d2a5ac)


You can now sort the information based on the options and search for specific information by typing it in the search bar.

You can make edits to each specific user profile, or delete it. You can even register a new user.
You can make changes to the users, hotels, bookings and staff if you are an admin

This is the different bookings:

![staff5](https://github.com/JeanieV/Hotel-Booking-App/assets/115072704/bd0c4f12-d086-4775-9d55-17845f50115e)


If it is green, the booking is completed, if it is red, then the booking was cancelled. If it is blue, then the booking will still take place.
